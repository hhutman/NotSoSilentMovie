    p
        | What we make and what we see, what we like and what we engage with, shapes us and shapes our world.
        | Storytelling, at some level,  is a means of cultural preservation and instilling moral values.
        br
        br
        | Silent Movie seeks to investigate what happens when we refuse to accept the story as it is presented to us.
        | It asks us to question, draw our own conclusions, to think critically.

        | In the experience, everyone begins with the same content, a set of video clips and title cards.
        | The video clips are cut from old, black and white American Westerns and the title cards
        | are taken from random parts of Jane Austenâ€™s Pride and Prejudice.
        br
        br
        | Silent Movie invites participants to consider these clips and assemble them in their own way to tell a new story.
        | It encourages and enables each of us to find our own meaning in the content provided.
